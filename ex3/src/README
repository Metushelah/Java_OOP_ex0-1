=============================
I decided implement ChainedHashSet using the CollectionFacade as to not create another
new class for it. This Facade masquaraded the LinkedList's inside each bucket.

In OpenHashSet i implemented the deletion using a flag string which compared to as
and object and if i found it then it acted like a null in the system.

The answer above.

i somehow failed each time in the last test when trying to delete "hello" but i
dont know why.

=============================
I failed to make results and analyze them because of lack of time, on my part
unfortunately. I suffered from a Chronic Procrastination attack and started the
exercise of the last day of the late submission. I am sorry, this is not because
i do not respect you or something of the sort, this is a problem with me and
i am sorry i couldn't complete it on time, i hope you will understand.
