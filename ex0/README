ProductType.java - implements the ProductType class.
Store.java - implements the Store class.
customer.java - implements the Customer class.

=============================
I implemented inside the Store class another private method named 
findProductPositionInArray(productTypeName) which returns an integer with the
position of the productName in the store array or -1 if not found.
I chose this way to avoid code repetition in the last 3 methods:
	sellsProductsOfType
	removeProductTypeFromStore
	makePurchase
which all affect and search for a singular product and according to the answers
in the forum given to us. 
Once the position is found it is evaluated (wheter -1 or number) and used 
accordingly.

Except for that i tried to remain within the API boundaries for each class.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I chose not to implement any serious programming methods such as sorts or 
binarySearch because we work with a small array of 5 so i simply ran over it
and searched for the products.

In all classes if a value given was a negative or a null, default values were
used accordingly and to the forums' answers. I also tried to make each method
handle such exceptions.
